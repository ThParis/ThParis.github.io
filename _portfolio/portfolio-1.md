Semarity Security is a work in progress project designed to detect bad actors in a workplace.  
The security system will utilize a combination of facial recognition software, audio analysis,  
and a web scraper to create a profile for individuals and determine their risk level. With   
certain action or at a particular risk level, the system will send alerts to notify about  
the potential threat. Important obstacles that the system will attempt to overcome is situations  
where a bad actor is actively trying to decieve the system and being able to synthesize the data   
collected to determine an accurate threat reading.

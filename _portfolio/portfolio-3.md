This application is designed for players of the popular online card game, Hearthstone. The program is pulled up at the same time as the
base game and tracks the cards left in the players deck and cards played by the opponent. This allows the player to know how likely they
are able to draw a card they need and to help them determine what cards the opponent has left in their deck. This project was built by a
team of eight people, with four people working on the front end UI and four people, including myself, working on the back-end. During this
project I started to learn about connections from the back-end code to the UI using json files as well as using data scraping applications
to pull information from the base game.

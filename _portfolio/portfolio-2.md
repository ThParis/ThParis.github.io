MemeUp is a social mobile application that matches people based off of their humor prefrences. After 
being matched up they can chat and send each other jokes and memes. This project incorporated a SQL database
to store the account and profile information. A big focus of the project was to ensure constant private 
communication between two people. MemeUp used Java for the back end and Android Studio and spring boot for the
front end UI.

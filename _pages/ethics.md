In response to Theranos case study: 

test info hereIf I was a software engineer on the project, I would have worked hard to make the project a reality and 
to make the products that were being advertised to the public a reality. I think that the problem lies in 
the lies from the higher ups in Theranos, not in the ambition. If I was an engineer on the project I would 
still try to live up to the ambition and create the best product I could. If I was a manager then I would try 
to manage expectations of the upper management so that they knew the product was being oversold 
and then try and do my best to manage my team to make the best product we could.

I think that the Theranos managers under Elizabeth Holmes did what they did because they that is what 
they were told to do. I think Elizabeth Holmes acted out of greed and lied to make money. I believe she 
knew that by lying she could get the money of the investors and use that to make even more money, 
similar to the recent Robinhood exploit that was exposed recently. People will take the actions 
necessary to maximize profits, even if it is unethical. I donâ€™t think the managers under Holmes acted out 
of greed, but instead was doing what Holmes told them to do because they wanted to keep their jobs.

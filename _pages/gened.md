GE1:
                My short-term goal is to secure a job in software engineering. My long-term goal 
				is to continuously provide quality work and to move up into a project management role. 
				I’m not quite sure if I want to be in a general project management role or in a technical 
				project management position but I plan on moving up into one of them.
 
GE2:
                The general education classes have helped me think about problems in new ways, not in just 
				how my mind thinks but in having more resources to pull knowledge from. They have helped me
				expanded my understanding of how people think, how the world works, and in how many different
				solutions can be applied to real-world problems every day. General education classes help me 
				think about engineering problems by widening my view to think about how the problem and my 
				solution impacts the world.
 
GE3:
                General Education classes help put problems, solutions and my thought processes into a global 
				context. Problems that arise in engineering don’t just need to be solved but need to be solved 
				in an efficient way that reduces the cost the solution has. A solution to a problem is not viable 
				if it can not be reasonably paid for, nor is it good if the problem is solved but another social 
				problem is created in the process. General education classes provide a look at how solutions can
				be made with help from other fields and give a unique perspective on the world.

CR1)
	Iowa State has prepared me to design systems and solve engineering problems 
	through the instruction of tools like data structures and then following them 
	with class projects that allowed us as students to create a project from our own 
	ideas and see them to fruition. This gave me the opportunity to work with a project 
	from its initial idea, develop every part of it, and then see it to the end. I had
	the chance to see a problem, create a solution to it, create how each individual parts
	of the system would work together, create the design documents, the architecture, and 
	the code. While doing this, in the class room I was learning about how these creations 
	should be created and used. Every idea that is brought into creation has an impact on 
	world. This impact could be social, changing how people communicate, or financial, 
	changing how resources in the world are used. The impacts could be listed forever.
	Having these experiances gives an incredible insight into how engineering works outside 
	the bubble of college studies.

CR2)
	One of the biggest things I have done while at Iowa State is work in group projects. 
	These projects help simulate working on a team in industry and provide the experience 
	needed to create products and projects from start to finish, including all of the hiccups 
	that come with working in the industry. General education classes, as well as upper class 
	software engineering classes, have taught me about the world and its complexities. This includes 
	how people live and think as well as the impact choices can make when we work professional and 
	ethically. These classes and seminars have gone into depth about how we should conduct ourselves 
	to strive to make the world a better place.

CR3)
	While working in class projects I have used outside information that I learned from things 
	such as an internship as well as projects created by other people. Fun side projects created
	by friends have helped provide inspiration or more insight to a solution that could be modified
	and used in my projects. The world continues to build off of the ideas of the people in the past.
	I have also learned from research done online to help learn about different ways to use things 
	we have learned in class. These new applications helped create a mindset in which I can think of
	how to use the tools I have in new and creative ways to solve problems in front of me.

CR4)
	The career fairs, and their practices, have helped me become a more professional person. They
	demonstrated the necessity of always holding yourself in a positive professional light. Being 
	in the Student Alumni Leadership Council has taught me more about being a leader and has helped
	my improve skills such as communication and networking to help get the right people and resources
	to solve problems at hand.

CR5)
	Learning can always be taken to another level or continued. I have started to read more about the
	C and C++ programing languages to help me get a much deeper understand and to provide me with new
	tools that can be used in the future. This has mainly been comprised of reading books and scientific articles.

CR6)
	If I were to do my undergraduate work again, I would join SALC earlier to start developing the
	leadership skills. In terms of the work that I have done while in my courses, I would not change
	too much. I think I am well prepared for industry work.
